# Raspberry Pi Based Battery Monitoring System

This project monitors battery voltage, current, power, and State of Charge using a Raspberry Pi and INA219 sensor.

## Tools Used
- Raspberry Pi
- INA219 Sensor
- 16x2 LCD
- Python

## Working
1. Battery parameters are measured using INA219.
2. Raspberry Pi processes the data and calculates SoC.
3. Data is displayed on LCD and logged into an Excel file.
